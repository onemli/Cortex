# Privacy Policy for Cortex

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## TL;DR
We don't collect anything. Your data never leaves your device.

---

## The Long Version

### What Data Do We Collect?
**None. Zero. Nada. Zilch.**

Cortex doesn't collect, store, transmit, or share any of your data. Period.

### What About My Bookmarks?
Your bookmarks are stored **locally on your device** using your browser's storage API.

- ‚ùå Not sent to our servers (we don't have servers)
- ‚ùå Not sent to third parties
- ‚ùå Not analyzed or tracked
- ‚úÖ 100% private, 100% yours

### What About Analytics?
**We don't use any.**

No Google Analytics. No tracking pixels. No telemetry. No "anonymous usage data."

We literally cannot see:
- What you bookmark
- How many bookmarks you have
- Which themes you use
- How often you use Cortex
- Anything about you

### What Permissions Does Cortex Use?

#### Storage Permission
**Why:** To save your bookmarks, categories, tags, and settings **on your device.**
**Where:** Your browser's local storage (never leaves your computer)

#### Bookmarks Permission
**Why:** To import bookmarks from your browser (only when you click "Sync Browser Bookmarks")
**Where:** Read from your browser, saved locally. Never transmitted anywhere.

#### Active Tab Permission
**Why:** To auto-fill the current page URL when adding a bookmark
**Where:** Only used when you manually add a bookmark. Never tracked.

#### Context Menu Permission
**Why:** To add "Add to Cortex" option when you right-click
**Where:** Creates a menu item. Doesn't access or store anything.

### Do You Use Third-Party Services?
**No.**

Cortex doesn't connect to:
- External APIs
- Ad networks
- Analytics platforms
- Cloud storage
- Literally anything outside your browser

### What About Updates?
Updates are distributed through:
- Chrome Web Store
- Firefox Add-ons
- GitHub Releases

These platforms may collect download statistics, but **we don't have access to that data.**

### Open Source = Transparent
Cortex is open source. You can inspect every line of code:
üëâ [github.com/onemli/cortex](https://github.com/onemli/cortex)

If we were secretly collecting data, you'd see it in the code. (Spoiler: we're not.)

### Can I Trust This?
**Yes, but don't just take our word for it:**

1. Read the source code (it's public)
2. Check browser DevTools (no network requests)
3. Review the permissions (minimal and necessary)
4. Ask the community

### Data Export & Deletion
**Export:** Click "Export Data" in settings. You get a JSON file with all your bookmarks.

**Deletion:** Uninstall Cortex. All data is automatically deleted from your browser's storage.

### Changes to This Policy
If we ever change how Cortex works (spoiler: we won't start collecting data), we'll update this policy and the version number in the extension.

Current version: v1.0.0
